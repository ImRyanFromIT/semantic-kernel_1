Hi SRM Team,

I need to update the owner notes for the "Storage Expansion - SAN/NAS/File Share" SRM.

Please add the following information to the owner notes:

"IMPORTANT: All storage expansion requests must now include a capacity justification and be approved by your director before submission. Please allow 5-7 business days for provisioning after approval. For urgent requests (< 48 hours), contact the Data Storage Team lead directly at storage-urgent@company.com."

Reason for this change: We've had several unauthorized expansion requests that caused budget overruns last quarter. This new process ensures proper capacity planning and budget approval before we provision additional storage resources.

Also, please update the hidden recommendation logic to:
- Recommend this SRM for keywords: "NetApp", "Dell EMC", "Pure Storage", "SAN expansion", "NAS expansion", "increase LUN size", "expand volume", "add disk shelf", "iSCSI", "Fiber Channel"
- Exclude from recommendations when query mentions: "new storage", "provision storage", "greenfield", "initial deployment", "first-time setup"

Thanks,
Mike Johnson
Data Storage Team Lead
