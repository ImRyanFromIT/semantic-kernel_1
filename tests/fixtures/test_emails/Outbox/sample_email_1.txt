Hi SRM Team,

I need to update the Application Server SRM owner notes. Please change the contact information to:

"For deployment requests, contact the Platform Team at platform-team@company.com. Include your project name and target environment in the request."

This change is needed because we're centralizing all deployment requests through the Platform Team starting next month.

Thanks,
John Doe
Platform Team Lead
