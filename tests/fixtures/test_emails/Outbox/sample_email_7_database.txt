Hi team,

I need to update the "Database Performance Consultation" SRM with new owner notes and recommendation logic.

Owner notes should read:

"Our DBA team provides expert analysis and optimization services for database performance issues. Please include query execution plans, wait statistics, and current resource utilization metrics in your request. Response time: 1-2 business days for standard requests, 4 hours for critical production issues. Contact: dba-team@company.com"

For the hidden recommendation logic, please add:
- Recommend for keywords: "slow query", "SQL performance", "query tuning", "index optimization", "execution plan", "deadlock", "blocking", "wait statistics", "SQL Server", "PostgreSQL", "MySQL", "database slow", "query timeout", "high CPU database", "TempDB", "table scan"
- Exclude when mentions: "database backup", "database restore", "database migration", "new database", "database installation", "database security audit"

Reasoning: We're seeing too many routing errors where backup/migration requests come to the performance team. These keywords should help route performance-specific issues correctly.

Best regards,
David Martinez
Database Services Team
