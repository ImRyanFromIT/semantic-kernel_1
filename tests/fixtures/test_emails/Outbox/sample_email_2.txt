Hello,

I need to update the hidden notes for the Database Server SRM. Please add the following recommendation logic:

- Recommend this SRM for applications requiring persistent data storage
- Do NOT recommend for temporary or cache-only workloads
- Exclude from recommendations for development environments (use lightweight alternatives instead)

The reason for this change is that we've been getting too many requests for database servers for simple dev work, which is expensive and unnecessary.

Best regards,
Sarah Smith
