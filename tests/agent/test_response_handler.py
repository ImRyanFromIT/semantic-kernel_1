Response Handler Tests

Purpose: Test response_handler.py functionality for sending email responses
        (success, rejection, escalation, clarification).

Type: Integration
Test Count: 7

Key Test Areas:
- send_success_notification (with owner_notes, hidden_notes)
- send_rejection_response
- send_escalation (with/without clarification history)
- send_clarification_request
- Error handling for Graph API failures

Dependencies:
- mock_graph_client fixture
- state_manager fixture
- response_handler fixture
