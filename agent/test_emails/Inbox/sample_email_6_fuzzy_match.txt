Subject: SRM Notes Update Request

Hello,

I need to update the owner notes for the "VM Provisionning" SRM (I think I might have misspelled it - it's the one about deploying new virtual machines).

Please change the notes to say:

"Before requesting a new VM, ensure you have completed the VM Request Form (available on the IT portal). All VMs must follow our naming convention: ENV-APP-###. Standard deployment time is 2-3 business days. For Windows VMs, include required licenses in your request."

Also, please add hidden recommendation logic:
- Recommend for keywords: "deploy VM", "new virtual machine", "VMware", "vSphere", "Hyper-V", "provision server", "need a VM", "create VM", "Windows Server", "Linux VM", "RHEL", "Ubuntu Server"
- Exclude when query mentions: "decommission", "delete VM", "snapshot", "performance issue", "troubleshooting"

We're getting too many incomplete requests and this should help guide users to the right SRM upfront.

Thanks!
