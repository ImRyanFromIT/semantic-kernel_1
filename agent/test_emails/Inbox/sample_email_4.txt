Hi,

I need help with some server thing but I'm not really sure which SRM I need. My manager said I should email you about getting some kind of infrastructure for our new project.

We're building something that needs to store data and serve web pages, but I don't know the technical details. Can someone help me figure out what I need?

Also, is there a way to get this set up by tomorrow? It's kind of urgent.

Thanks,
