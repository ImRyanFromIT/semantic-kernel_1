This is an automated message from the SRM Archivist Agent, which processes SRM updates on behalf of the team.\n\nI've reviewed your request and need clarification on the following points before I can proceed with the update:\n\n1. Could you please clarify what the 'old process' refers to for handling emergencies? A brief description or example would help ensure we document it correctly.\n2. The request lists two different contacts — platform-team@company.com and John — for different situations. Could you confirm which contact should be used for general inquiries and which for urgent issues, or if both remain valid under specific conditions?\n3. The hidden notes update mentions 'improve recommendation for relevant use cases.' Could you please specify what improvements or changes you’d like made to the recommendation logic so we can update it accurately?\n\nPlease reply to this email with clarification on these items. Once I receive your response, I'll complete the SRM update automatically.\n\nNote: If you're unable to provide this information or would prefer to work with a human representative, please reply with \"connect me with a human\" and your request will be escalated to the support team immediately.\n\nBest regards,\nSRM Archivist Agent\nAutomated SRM Management System\nA: Im not sure\n\nClarification 2:\nQ: Hello,\n\nThank you for your reply. I understand you’re unsure about some of the details. Let me ask more specifically to make this easier:\n\n1. When you mentioned the 'old process' for handling emergencies, could you tell me who used to handle those requests or what steps were followed? For example, did they go through a specific team or email alias?\n2. Between platform-team@company.com and John, which one should be contacted first when an urgent issue arises? Or should both be notified?\n3. For the recommendation logic improvements, could you give one example of a use case where the current recommendation isn’t working well, or describe what kind of improvement you’d like to see (e.g., faster response, more accurate matching, etc.)?\n\nPlease reply to this email with any details you can provide, even brief notes are fine. Once I have that information, I’ll complete the SRM update automatically.\n\nNote: If you’d prefer to work with a human representative instead, please reply with “connect me with a human” and your request will be escalated to the support team immediately.\n\nBest regards,\nSRM Archivist Agent\nAutomated SRM Management System\nA: Not sure\n\n\nLATEST REPLY:\nNot sure\n", "received_datetime": "2025-10-27T18:09:39+00:00", "conversation_id": "AAQkAGVkYmFiM2E0LWJkZDgtNDQzNi1hOTg0LTVkZmZmNTFhZWRjOQAQANmsvqH0iRFFt-rG4vRSumc=", "classification": "help", "confidence": 95, "reason": "Clear request to update owner notes and hidden notes for specific SRMs (Application Server and Storage Expansion) with detailed instructions for owner notes and a general note about hidden notes.", "status": "escalating", "timestamp": "2025-10-27T18:12:09.661393", "extracted_data": {"srm_title": "Application Server SRM, Storage Expansion SRM", "change_type": "both", "change_description": "Update owner notes to direct requests through Mike's team while keeping the old process for emergencies, and update contact to platform-team@company.com but note that John should still be contacted for urgent issues.
