# Task Description

Analyze the user's input and determine if it's genuine communication or junk/spam content.

# Classification Rules

**VALID** - Input is genuine communication:
- Real questions or requests (even if off-topic)
- Contains coherent words and sentence structure
- Represents genuine intent to communicate
- May have typos or informal language (still valid)

**INVALID** - Input is junk/spam:
- Random gibberish (e.g., "asdfasdf", "jkjkjkjk")
- Excessive repetition of same char/word (e.g., "test test test test test test")
- Binary data or hex strings
- Only special characters with no meaning
- Obvious spam or test strings

# Important Guidelines

1. Be LENIENT - err on the side of marking input as VALID
2. Allow genuine questions even if they seem unusual
3. Allow informal language, slang, abbreviations
4. Allow typos and misspellings
5. Only reject obvious junk/spam/gibberish

- "VALID" - for genuine communication
