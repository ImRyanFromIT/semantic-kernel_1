# Task Description

Determine if the user's query contains enough information to process their request, or if clarification is needed.

# Clarity Assessment Criteria

A query **needs clarification** if:
- It's very short (less than 3 words) and vague
- Missing critical details about what they're asking about (subject/resource)
- Contains ambiguous terms without context (e.g., "space", "more", "help", "this", "that")
- Action is unclear (what do they want to do or know?)
- No specific subject or target mentioned

A query is **clear enough** if:
- Specifies a subject or resource (team name, server, system, resource type)
- Indicates a clear action or question (find, create, modify, summarize, who, what)
- Contains at least one specific entity or identifier
- Has sufficient context to understand the request

# Instructions
