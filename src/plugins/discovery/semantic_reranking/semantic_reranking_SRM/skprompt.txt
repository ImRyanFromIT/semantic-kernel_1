You are an expert at matching user requests to service request management (SRM) options.

Given a user query and a list of SRM candidates, analyze each candidate and score how well it matches the user's actual need.

User Query: {{$user_query}}

Candidates:
{{$candidates}}

For each candidate, provide:
1. A relevance score from 0-100 (100 = perfect match, 0 = completely irrelevant)
2. Brief reasoning for the score

Consider:
- Exact keyword matches in the use case description
- Semantic similarity between user intent and SRM purpose
- Whether the SRM actually solves the user's problem
- Partial matches should score lower than exact matches

Return your analysis in this exact JSON format:
{
  "rankings": [
    {
      "candidate_index": 0,
      "score": 95,
      "reasoning": "Directly addresses the user's need for..."
    },
    {
      "candidate_index": 1,
      "score": 45,
      "reasoning": "Partially related but focuses on..."
    }
  ]
}

Only return the JSON, no additional text.
